//Climbing staris Leetcode 70
/*
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
*/
using namespace std;

/*
First of all, how do you recognize it is a dp problem?
Hints: 
1. If question starts like - count no. of ways.
2. Or, if the question starts like - there are multiple ways of doing something, give which gives the maximum or minimum output.
3. Concept of try all possible ways

Recursion can be used to try all possible ways.
*/

/*
Shortcut for Dynamic Programming questions
1. Try to represent the problem in terms of index.
2. Do all the possible stuff on that index according to the problem statement.
3. For:
    i. COUNT ALL WAYS : Sum of all stuffs
    ii. FIND MIN      : Minimum of all stuffs.
    iii. FIND MAX     : Maximum of all stuffs.
