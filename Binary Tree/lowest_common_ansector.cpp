/*
Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: â€œThe lowest common ancestor is defined between 
two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).

    Give a left call and right call.

    If you find NULL or address of nodes equal to given any of the 2 address, return root.
    Since, returning NULL root would also given NULL.

    Check if left returned address is not NULL and right returned address is also not NULL.
    If yes, then return the current node address, as it is the lowest common ancestor.

    If a call returns NULL, but other call returns address, return that address.
    IF both calls returns NULL, return null.
