Recursion:
Recursive function solves a problem by calling itself and solving smaller problems first of original problem.
It doesn't always require Backtracking.



Backtracking:
Backtracking uses recursion to solve a problem.
If we know a choice will not give us the required answer in recursion, we will Backtrack from there.
It will only proceed with choices that can give us the require answer.
